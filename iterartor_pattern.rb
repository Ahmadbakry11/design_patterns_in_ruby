# In case we have some object that is internally composed of other objects and we may need to sequence 
# through all of the sub-objects without needing to know any of the details of how the aggregate object is storing them.

# Here we may need the Iterator pattern, a technique that allows an
# aggregate object to provide the outside world with a way to access its collection of sub-objects. 

# The GoF tell us that the Iterator pattern will do the following:
#   "Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without
#   exposing its underlying representation"

# In other words, an Iterator provides the outside world with a sort of movable
# pointer into the objects stored inside an otherwise opaque aggregate object.

# 1- External Iterator:
# ------------------------

# It is called External because the iterator is a separate object from the aggregate. 

# We can build our own version of a Java external iterator.

class ArrayIterator
  def initialize(array)
    @array = array 
    @index = 0
  end

  def has_next?
    @index < @array.length
  end

  def item
    @array[@index]
  end

  def next_item
    value = @array[@index]
    @index += 1 
    value
  end
end

# Here is how we might use our new iterator.

array = ['red', 'green', 'blue']
i = ArrayIterator.new(array)

while i.has_next?
  puts("item: #{i.next_item}")
end

# With just a few lines of code, our ArrayIterator gives us just about everything
# we need to iterate over any Ruby array. As a free bonus, Rubyâ€™s flexible dynamic typ-
# ing allows ArrayIterator to work on any aggregate class that has a length method and
# can be indexed by an integer. String is just such a class, and our ArrayIterator
# will work fine with strings:

i = ArrayIterator.new('abc')

while i.has_next?
  puts("item: #{i.next_item}")    #this will return the strring as a number(charcter code).
end

while i.has_next?
  puts("item: #{i.next_item.chr}")
end


# Although, that was so effecient, but external iterators are rarely used in ruby.
# Ruby has something better to solve such problem(iteration) and it is built on top of code block and the 
# Proc object.

# 2- Internal Iterators 
# -----------------------

# it is called internal iterators, because all of the iterating action
# occurs inside the aggregate object, the code block-based iterators are called internal
# iterators.

# Building internal iterator in ruby is verty easy using code blocks

def for_each_element(array)
  i = 0
  while i < array.length
    yield(array[i]) if block_given?
    i += 1 
  end 
end

for_each_element(array) { |element| puts element }

# The Array class sports with its own iterator called each 

array.each {|element| puts("The element is #{element}")}

# ----------------------

# Enumerable
# -----------------
# If you do find yourself creating an aggregate class and equipping it with an internal
# iterator, you should probably consider including the Enumerable mixin module in
# your class.

# There are 2 conditions to do so:

# 1- you need only make sure that your internal iterator method is named "each"
# 2- the individual elements that you are going to iterate over have a reasonable implementation of 
# the (spaceship operator) <=> comparison operator.

# We need to mention also here that mixing the Enumerable module will supply
# you with a all the goodness methods included in the Enumerable module.
# Here is an example for that.

class Account
  attr_accessor :name, :balance

  def initialize(name, balance)
    @name = name 
    @balance = balance 
  end

  def <=>(other)
    balance <=> other.balance
  end
end

class Portofolio
  include Enumerable

  attr_accessor :accounts 

  def initialize
    @accounts = []
  end

  def each(&block)
    @accounts.each(&block)
  end

  def add_account(account)
    @accounts << account
  end
end

# By simply mixing the Enumerable module into Portfolio and defining an
# each method, we have equipped Portfolio with all kinds of Enumerable goodness.
# For example, we can now find out whether any of the accounts in our portfolio has a
# balance of at least $2,000:

my_portfolio.any? {|account| account.balance > 2000}

# We can also find out whether all of our accounts contain at least $10:

my_portfolio.all? {|account| account.balance > = 10}
# ========================================================

# Using and Abusing the Iterator Pattern
# ----------------------------------------

# Unfortunately, none of the iterators that we have built in this chapter so far react
# particularly well to change. Recall that our external ArrayIterator worked by hold-
# ing on to the index of the current item. Deleting elements from the array that we have
# not seen yet is not a problem, but making modifications to the beginning of the array
# will wreak havoc with the indexing.

# We can make our ArrayIterator resistant to changes to the underlying array by
# simply making a copy of the array in the iterator constructor:

class ChangeResistantArrayIterator
  def initialize(array)
    @array = Array.new(array)
    @index = 0
  end

# Internal iterators have exactly the same concurrent modification problems as
# external iterators. For example, it is probably a very bad idea to do the following:

array=['red', 'green', 'blue', 'purple']
array.each do | color |
  puts(color)
  if color == 'green'
    array.delete(color)
  end
end

# This will print:

# red
# green
# purple

# Internal iterators can also defend against the crime of modifying while iterating
# by working on a separate copy of the aggregate, just as we did in our
# ChangeResistantArrayIterator class. This might look something like the following
# code:

def change_resistant_for_each_element(array)
  copy = Array.new(array)
  i = 0

  while i < copy.length
    yield(copy[i])
    i += 1
  end
end

#=============================================

# Some notes from the Head First Design Pattern Book and GO4 book:
#------------------

# The GO4 representation:

# 1- We need to define an abstract Iteratable interface or class.This represents what is called Enumerable
#    in some oop languages.

# 2- We need to define an abstract class or interface called Iterator which represents the iterator we build 
#    to iterate through the iteratable.This represents what is called Enumerator
#    in some oop languages.


# 3- the Iteratable interface needs to have an abstract method called get_iterator()
#    which returns an Iterator

# 4- And, we will have ConcreateIteratable classes inheriting from or implementing the Iteratable interface 
#    with a concreate implementation for the get_iterator() method depending on the iteratable structure.

# 5- And also, we need to have ConcreateIterator classes that inherit from the abstract Iterator depending 
#    on the iteratable structure

# 6- The reason for having get_iterator() abstract method in the Iteratable class or interface is that
#    we need to treat our ConcreateIteratable classes uniformly depending on how we iterate through the structure
#    array, linkedlist, tree, account for example. 
   
# 7- In fact, the get_iterator method or idea is an instance of the factory method pattern .
#    The ConcreateIteratable, implements a method get_iterator which creates a ConcreateIterator instance.
#    The Iteratable is a factory that constructs Iteraots

# 8- The Iterator super class needs to have the following methods.

#    * has_next?(): which returns a boolean depending on whether we reached the end of the iteratable or not.

#    * next(): a void method that does not return any thing but mutates the state of the iterator.
#       i.e. points to the next element in the structure.
#       It is better to avoid mutation by making the method next returning a new version of itself
#       pointing to the next element.
#       Make th copy carry the new informaton or the new state.
#    * current() or item(): which returns the item we need and it is of type Item for example if we have
#       a collection or an enumerable of items.

#    * In some cases like above we merge those two methods next() and current() in one method
#      So, in one request get the item and increment the pointer to the next item in the collection.
#      But this is a violation for waht is called Command Query Separator principle which states that:

#      "Separate methods that perform queries from methods that excute commands"

#      Imagine that you hae a DB query which asking for something from the DB and at the same time 
#      it updates another DB record or changes the state of the DB.That is super confusing.
#      for more details: https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CommandQuerySeparation.html

#      There is another example for that violation: poppinf from the stack.

# 9- As a summary, concreate iteratble produces a concreate iterator.It is a relationship betwena concreate 
#    iteratable and a concreate iterator
